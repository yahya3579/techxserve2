# Fix: Large Files Already Committed

## Problem
The video files were committed to Git as regular files before Git LFS could handle them. Now GitHub is rejecting the push because they're too large.

## Solution: Migrate Existing Files to Git LFS

Follow these commands in order:

### Step 1: Verify Git LFS is Installed

```powershell
git lfs version
```

If not installed, run:
```powershell
winget install GitHub.GitLFS
git lfs install
```

### Step 2: Remove the Remote (We'll Add It Back)

```powershell
git remote remove origin
```

### Step 3: Migrate Existing Files to LFS

This command will rewrite your Git history to move large files to LFS:

```powershell
git lfs migrate import --include="*.mp4,*.mov,*.avi,*.mkv,*.webm" --everything
```

This will:
- Find all video files in your Git history
- Convert them to Git LFS pointers
- Rewrite the commits

### Step 4: Verify Files Are Now in LFS

```powershell
git lfs ls-files
```

You should see all your video files listed here.

### Step 5: Add Remote Back

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/yahya3579/TechxServe.git
```

### Step 6: Force Push (Since History Was Rewritten)

```powershell
git push -f origin master
```

**Note:** The `-f` (force) flag is needed because we rewrote the Git history. This is safe since you just created the repo.

## Alternative Method: Start Fresh (Simpler)

If the above doesn't work, here's a cleaner approach:

### Step 1: Delete GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/yahya3579/TechxServe/settings
2. Scroll to bottom â†’ "Delete this repository"
3. Follow the prompts

### Step 2: Reset Your Local Git (Keep Files)

```powershell
# Remove the git remote
git remote remove origin

# Go back to the state before large files were committed
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Or completely reset git (nuclear option)
# rm -rf .git
# git init
```

### Step 3: Set Up Git LFS FIRST

```powershell
git lfs install
```

### Step 4: Add .gitattributes FIRST

```powershell
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Add Git LFS configuration"
```

### Step 5: Now Add Everything Else

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with LFS-tracked media files"
```

### Step 6: Verify LFS is Tracking

```powershell
git lfs ls-files
```

You should see all video files listed.

### Step 7: Create New GitHub Repo and Push

```powershell
# Create new repo at https://github.com/new
# Then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yahya3579/TechxServe.git
git push -u origin master
```

## Recommended: Use Alternative Method

The **Alternative Method (Start Fresh)** is simpler and cleaner since you just created the repository. It ensures Git LFS is properly configured from the start.
